This tool is a chat interface builder designed to deliver an engaging and seamlessly embedded chatbot experience. By leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs) and the conversational capabilities of watsonX Assistant, the AI Assistant Builder enables dynamic and interactive conversations between users and watsonX Orchestrate. Accessing the watsonX Orchestrate Platform \u00b6 To create an AI Assistant in watsonX Orchestrate, you first need to access the platform and navigate to the AI Assistant Builder. 1. Log in to watsonX Orchestrate \u00b6 Open your web browser and go to the watsonX Orchestrate portal. Enter your IBM credentials and sign in. 2. Navigate to the Home Page \u00b6 Upon logging in, you will land on the watsonX Orchestrate home page. This page provides options to build AI skills, automate tasks, and explore learning resources. 3. Access the AI Assistant Builder \u00b6 In the \"Build\" section, find the \"AI Assistant Builder\" card. Click on it to begin creating your AI Assistant. Building your AI assistant with actions \u00b6 In the AI Assistant Builder, an action is a specific outcome your AI assistant completes in response to a user's request. Actions consist of steps, which guide the conversation between the user and the AI assistant. The interaction starts with user input (e.g., \"I want to withdraw money\"), may involve additional exchanges for gathering information, and concludes when the assistant fulfils the request. You can design AI assistants that function like personal assistants by creating AI-guided actions, skill-based actions, or custom-built actions. The examples in this guide demonstrate building a money withdrawal action. You can modify these to suit your own use case. To create AI assistant , do the following steps \u00b6 1. Enter Assistant Name In the \"Assistant name\" field, enter a meaningful name for your assistant. Example: Fund Management Bot (or any other relevant name based on your use case). The name is used internally and is not visible to end users. 2. Provide a Description (Optional) You can add a short description that summarizes the purpose of this assistant.Example: \"A chatbot to assist users with fund management queries and investment options.\"This step is optional but helps in organizing multiple assistants. 3. Select Assistant Language From the \"Assistant language\" dropdown, choose the preferred language for the assistant.By default, English (U.S.) is selected. 4. Proceed to the Next Step Click the \"Next\" button at the top-right corner to continue to the Personalization step. \u2003 Personalizing Your Assistant \u00b6 In this step, you will personalize your AI assistant by specifying where it will be deployed, your industry, role, and the assistant\u2019s purpose. These choices will help tailor the onboarding experience. Instructions \u00b6 1. Deployment Channel Under \"Tell us where your assistant will live\", select where you plan to deploy the assistant. Options may include Web, Mobile App, Messaging Platforms, or Others. Example: Select \"Web\" if you plan to use the assistant on a website. 2. Provide Industry Information In the \"Which industry do you work in?\" dropdown, select your industry.Example: Banking and Financial Services (if the assistant is for a finance-related use case). 3. Define Your Role In \"What is your role on the team building the assistant?\", choose the most relevant role. Example: Designer, Developer, Product Manager, etc. 4. Select a Need Statement Choose a statement that best describes your AI assistant\u2019s purpose.Example: \"I want to make it easier for my customers to find what they\u2019re looking for in my app.\"This helps refine the assistant\u2019s focus and experience. ## Customizing Your Assistant UI In this step, you will customize the chat UI to align with your brand identity. You can set the assistant\u2019s display name, theme, colons, and other appearance settings. Instructions \u00b6 1. Set the Assistant's Display Name Under \"Assistant\u2019s name as known by customers\", enter the name that users will see when they interact with the assistant.Example: \"Fund Management Assistant\" 2. Choose the Intended Purpose Select an option based on the assistant\u2019s main use case: Standard: For customer support and virtual agent use cases. Carbon for AI: If integrating with IBM internal AI-focused applications. Recommended: Standard for most business use cases. 3. Select a Theme Choose between Light or Dark mode based on your brand style.Example: Light mode for a clean, professional look. 4. Customize Colors Primary Color (Chat Header): Define the main color of the assistant's interface.Secondary Color (User Message Bubble): Choose a contrasting color for messages sent by users.Account Color (Special AI Actions): Assign a color to highlight AI-driven responses. Example: Primary: #FFFFFF (White) Secondary: #303D1D (Dark Green) Account: #0345AE (Blue) 5. Set Chat Widget Size (Optional) Adjust the width and height of the chatbot window.Default: Width \u2013 380px, Height \u2013 640px(Leave as is if unsure). 6. IBM Watermark Enable or Disable the \"Built with IBM WatsonX\" watermark based on preference. 7. Enable Streaming (Optional) Streaming allows messages to appear dynamically as they are being typed.Recommended: Keep ON for a more natural user experience. 8. Upload an Avatar Image (Optional) Click \"Add an avatar image\" to upload a custom icon for your assistant. Previewing Your Assistant \u00b6 In this step, you will preview how your AI assistant appears and functions on a website before finalizing the setup. This allows you to test interactions and ensure the chatbot is visually and functionally aligned with your requirements. Instructions \u00b6 1. Review the Chatbot Preview The right panel displays a simulated website with the chatbot embedded.Interact with the assistant by typing a message in the input field to see how it responds.Verify that the UI elements, colors, and avatar (if uploaded) appear correctly. 2. Customize Web Chat (Optional) Click \"Customize web chat\" to modify the chatbot\u2019s appearance further.You can adjust its layout, colors, and positioning based on your website\u2019s design. 3. Share the Preview (Optional) Click \"Copy link to share\" to generate a preview link that you can send to stakeholders for feedback. Creating an AI-guided action \u00b6 You can create AI-guided actions to help your assistants to respond to a specific set of inquiries that are based on the preloaded knowledge and instructions. To create an AI-guided action, do the following steps: \u00b6 1. Click the AI assistant builder tile in watsonX Orchestrate to go to AI assistant builder. 2. In AI assistant builder, go to Actions > New action > AI-guided action. 3. In the New action dialog, enter the phrase that the customer must type to start the interaction. Example \u2013 GenAI Chat Action 4. Click Save. 5. In the AI-guided action page, select the large language model (LLM) from the Select a model dropdown. For more information about models. Example - granite-3b-instruct model (recommended) 6. Optional: In the Add knowledge* field, you can add a content, which is the knowledge reference for the AI-guided action. This knowledge is sent to the LLM along with the prompt**. 7. In the Add prompt instructions section, click the Add instructions button if you want to add instructions for the default prompt in your assistant. 8. Enter the prompt instructions in the Prompt instruction field that help the LLM in your assistant to give refined responses and guide the conversations with clarity and specificity. !!! info \u201cKnowledge\u201d You are digital assistant at Wealth Bank.
